  # 🧬 TEOS-NFT-AI-Generator

**Empowering Cultural Expression through AI & NFTs**  
A civic-grade NFT generator that transforms contributor prompts into ritual-grade digital artifacts — preserving Egypt’s blockchain legacy, one chapter at a time.

---

## 🌍 Vision

TEOS-NFT-AI-Generator rewards civic participation, sponsor resurrection, and contributor sovereignty through AI-generated NFTs. Each artifact encodes a chapter of Egypt’s digital legacy — minted with clarity, ritual, and reproducibility.

Inspired by modular flows from ChainGPT’s AI NFT Generator, this repo adapts prompt-to-image logic, metadata control, and multi-chain minting for cultural and civic use cases.
