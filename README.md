## 🌐 Network Integration

TEOS supports seamless deployment across leading blockchain networks:

| Network    | Status    | Token Standard |
|------------|-----------|----------------|
| Ethereum   | ✅ Active | ERC-721        |
| Solana     | ✅ Active | SPL Token/NFT  |
| BNB Chain  | ✅ Active | BEP-721        |

Each NFT is minted directly onto the selected chain, with metadata stored in decentralized storage (e.g. IPFS).

## 🔰 ERT & TGR Modules

**ERT (Egyptian Ritual Tokenization)**  
> Converts historical and mythic inputs into AI-rendered visual assets with ritual-grade metadata — embedding chapter, role, and cultural lineage.

**TGR (Tokenized Guardian Rituals)**  
> Enables faction-based minting for groups like Nile Guardians, Desert Coders, and Alexandria Archivists. Supports contributor badges, chapter alignment, and governance unlocks.

# TEOS: NFT AI Generator

TEOS is an AI-powered tool designed to simplify and revolutionize the creation of Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs). It leverages advanced artificial intelligence to generate unique digital art assets based on user-defined descriptions, making NFT creation accessible to artists, developers, and enthusiasts alike.

## Key Features

*   **AI-Generated Art:** Utilizes AI models to generate unique and creative images from text prompts. [2, 3]
*   **Customizable Designs:** Offers options to select or customize design attributes, allowing for a personal touch in NFT creation. [2]
*   **User-Friendly Interface:** Designed to be intuitive for both beginners and experienced users. [2]
*   **NFT Minting Capabilities:** Enables users to mint their AI-generated art directly as NFTs on blockchain platforms. [3]
*   **High-Quality Outputs:** Generates NFTs in high-resolution formats, ready for deployment on various marketplaces. [2]
*   **Layer-Based System (Potential):** Facilitates the management and combination of multiple layers for complex design elements. [2]
*   **Cross-Platform Compatibility:** Works on common operating systems like Windows 10/11. [2]

## How it Works

1.  **Connect Wallet:** Link your compatible cryptocurrency wallet (e.g., MetaMask) to the application. [3]
2.  **Describe Your NFT:** Provide a textual description or select predefined attributes for the artwork you wish to generate. [3]
3.  **AI Generation:** The AI model processes your input to create a unique image. [3]
4.  **Review & Customize:** View the generated artwork and make any necessary adjustments or select from customization options. [2, 3]
5.  **Mint Your NFT:** Once satisfied, proceed to mint the artwork as an NFT on the blockchain. [3]

## Getting Started

### Installation

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Elmahrosa/TEOS-NFT-AI-Generator.git
    cd TEOS-NFT-AI-Generator
    ```
2.  **Install Dependencies:**
    (This section would typically list specific commands for installing Python packages, Node.js modules, etc., depending on the project's tech stack. For example:)
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    # or
    npm install
    ```
3.  **Configuration:**
    Set up any necessary API keys or environment variables as required by the AI models or blockchain interactions. (e.g., OpenAI API key, Thirdweb Engine setup). [7]

### Usage

1.  Launch the TEOS application.
2.  Follow the on-screen prompts to connect your wallet.
3.  Enter your desired NFT description or customize attributes.
4.  Click the generate button to have the AI create your artwork.
5.  Select "Mint NFT" to deploy your creation to the blockchain.

## Technology Stack (Inferred)

*   **AI Image Generation:** Likely uses models like OpenAI's DALL-E or Stable Diffusion. [3, 7]
*   **Blockchain Integration:** Utilizes blockchain technology for NFT minting, potentially using platforms like Ethereum or compatible chains. [3, 7]
*   **Smart Contracts:** ERC721 compliant smart contracts for NFT creation. [3]
*   **Decentralized Storage:** May employ IPFS for storing NFT metadata and images. [3]
*   **Frontend/Backend:** (Specifics would depend on the project's implementation - e.g., Python with Flask/Django, Node.js with Express, React/Vue for frontend).
