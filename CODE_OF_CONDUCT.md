# Contributor Code of Conduct

As contributors and maintainers of the TEOS NFT AI Generator, and as members of the broader TEOS Egypt community, we pledge to foster an open and welcoming environment rooted in respect, collaboration, and civic purpose.

## Our Pledge

We commit to making participation in our project a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, ethnicity, gender identity, level of experience, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or technology choices.

We are building tools that preserve and promote Egyptian cultural identity. Every contribution should reflect that mission.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment:
- Clear, respectful communication
- Constructive feedback and reproducible code
- Acknowledging and celebrating Egyptian heritage and civic values
- Supporting newcomers and mentoring contributors

Examples of unacceptable behavior:
- Disrespectful or discriminatory language
- Trolling, insults, or personal attacks
- Publishing others‚Äô private information without consent
- Dismissing civic or cultural contributions as ‚Äúnon-technical‚Äù

## Our Responsibilities

Maintainers are responsible for clarifying standards and taking appropriate action in response to unacceptable behavior. They have the right to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, and other contributions that violate this Code of Conduct.

## Scope

This Code applies within all project spaces‚ÄîGitHub issues, pull requests, Discord, Telegram, and any other community channels‚Äîand in public spaces when representing the project.

## Enforcement
